  Given two Gaussian distribution with means m and m_w and covariance matrices
  C and C_w, this function calculates

              |m - m_w|^2 + Tr(C + C_w - 2(C * C_w)^(1/2))

  which captures how different the distributions of real images and generated
  images (or more accurately, their visual features) are. Note that unlike the
  Inception score, this is a true distance and utilizes information about real
  world images.

  Note that when computed using sample means and sample covariance matrices,
  Frechet distance is biased. It is more biased for small sample sizes. (e.g.
  even if the two distributions are the same, for a small sample size, the
  expected Frechet distance is large). It is important to use the same
  sample size to compute Frechet classifier distance when comparing two
  generative models.

  NOTE: This function consumes inputs, computes their activations, and then
  computes the classifier score. If you would like to precompute many
  activations for large batches, please use
  frechet_clasifier_distance_from_activations(), which this method also uses.

  real images and generated images. This can be used independently of the
  kernel_classifier_distance() method, especially in the case of using large
  batches during evaluation where we would like to precompute all of the
  activations before computing the classifier distance, or if we want to
  compute multiple metrics based on the same images.

  This technique is described in detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01401.
  Given two distributions P and Q of activations, this function calculates

      E_{X, X' ~ P}[k(X, X')] + E_{Y, Y' ~ Q}[k(Y, Y')]
        - 2 E_{X ~ P, Y ~ Q}[k(X, Y)]

  where k is the polynomial kernel

      k(x, y) = ( x^T y / dimension + 1 )^3.

  This captures how different the distributions of real and generated images'
  visual features are. Like the Frechet distance (and unlike the Inception
  score), this is a true distance and incorporates information about the
  target images. Unlike the Frechet score, this function computes an
  *unbiased* and asymptotically normal estimator, which makes comparing
  estimates across models much more intuitive.

  The estimator used takes time quadratic in max_block_size. Larger values of
  max_block_size will decrease the variance of the estimator but increase the
  computational cost. This differs slightly from the estimator used by the
  original paper; it is the block estimator of https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1954.

  NOTE: the blocking code assumes that real_activations and
  generated_activations are both in random order. If either is sorted in a
  meaningful order, the estimator will behave poorly.
