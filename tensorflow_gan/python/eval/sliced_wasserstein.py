"""Implementation of Sliced Wasserstein Distance.

Proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196 and the official Theano
implementation that we used as reference can be found here:
https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans

Note: this is not an exact distance but an approximation through random
projections.
