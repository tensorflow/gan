"""TF-GAN is a lightweight library for training and evaluating GANs.

In addition to providing the infrastructure for easily training and evaluating
GANS, this library contains modules for a TF-GAN-backed Estimator,
evaluation metrics, features (such as virtual batch normalization), and losses.
Please see README.md for details and usage.

We construct the interface here, and remove undocumented symbols. The high-level
structure should be:
tfgan
-> .estimator
-> .eval
-> .features
-> .losses
  -> .wargs
-> .tpu
