    """Custom getter that performs Spectral Normalization on a weight tensor.

  Specifically it divides the weight tensor by its largest singular value. This
  is intended to stabilize GAN training, by making the discriminator satisfy a
  local 1-Lipschitz constraint.

  Based on [Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks][sn-gan].

  [sn-gan]: https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1QRgziT-

  To reproduce an SN-GAN, apply this custom_getter to every weight tensor of
  your discriminator. The last dimension of the weight tensor must be the number
  of output channels.

  Apply this to layers by supplying this as the `custom_getter` of a
  `tf.variable_scope`. For example:

    with tf.variable_scope(
        'discriminator', custom_getter=spectral_normalization_custom_getter()):
      net = discriminator_fn(net)

  It is important to carefully select to which weights you want to apply
  Spectral Normalization. In general you want to normalize the kernels of
  convolution and dense layers, but you do not want to normalize biases. You
  also want to avoid normalizing batch normalization (and similar) variables,
  but in general such layers play poorly with Spectral Normalization, since the
  gamma can cancel out the normalization in other layers. By default we supply a
  filter that matches the kernel variable names of the dense and convolution
  layers of the tf.layers, tf.contrib.layers, tf.keras and tf.contrib.slim
  libraries. If you are using anything else you'll need a custom `name_filter`.

  This custom getter internally creates a variable used to compute the spectral
  norm by power iteration. It will update every time the variable is accessed,
  which means the normalized discriminator weights may change slightly whilst
  training the generator. Whilst unusual, this matches how the paper's authors
  implement it, and in general additional rounds of power iteration can't hurt.

  IMPORTANT: Keras does not respect the custom_getter supplied by the
  VariableScope, so this approach won't work for Keras layers. For Keras layers
  each layer needs to have Spectral Normalization explicitly applied. This
  should be accomplished using code like:

    my_layer = tf.keras.layers.SomeLayer()
    layer.build(inputs.shape)
    layer.kernel = spectral_normalize(layer.kernel)
    outputs = layer.apply(inputs)

  Args:
    name_filter: Optionally, a method that takes a Variable name as input and
      returns whether this Variable should be normalized.
    power_iteration_rounds: The number of iterations of the power method to
      perform per step. A higher number yields a better approximation of the
      true spectral norm.
    equality_constrained: If set to `True` will normalize the matrix such that
      its spectral norm is equal to 1, otherwise, will normalize the matrix such
      that its norm is at most 1.
    training: Whether to update the spectral normalization on variable
      access. This is useful to turn off during eval, for example, to not affect
      the graph during evaluation.

  Returns:
    A custom getter function that applies Spectral Normalization to all
    Variables whose names match `name_filter`.
