"""TF-GAN is a lightweight library for training and evaluating GANs.

In addition to providing the infrastructure for easily training and evaluating
GANS, this library contains modules for a TF-GAN-backed Estimator,
evaluation metrics, features (such as virtual batch normalization), and losses.
Please see README.md for details and usage.
